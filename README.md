Course: __DV2594 H20 lp12 Machine Learning for Streaming Data, Blekinge Institute of Technology__

## Project goals
Predict how well Swedish research projects are meeting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals ([17 Global Goals](https://www.globalamalen.se/)) by analaysing the historical research applications from [SweCRIS](https://www.swecris.se/) and match them with the UN's global goals (in Swedish: Globala målen)

## Project boundaries

1. Language of the documents (for analysis): Swedish
2. Document set: Application submission abstracts collected from [SweCRIS](https://www.swecris.se/)
3. In the first phase collected data from web about global goals will be used as base for learning, classifying and prediction
4. Tagged data provided by [Formas](https://formas.se/) and [Vinnova](https://vinnova.se) will be used to evaluate models (SVM and Multinomial Naïve Bayes)
